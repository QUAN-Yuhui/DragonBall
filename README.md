# DragonBall
A  c++ console application to reconstruct a clapping game in my middle school.
The names of moves are modified to facilitate understanding.

Details of the game
**Basics and terminology**
1. Two players exert **moves** at the same time in every round.
2. **Moves** include **attack** (small, middle and big), **save energy**, and **defense**(small, middle and big).  
3. There is a key parameter called **energy** which is the basis for certain moves. 

**Release of energy**
4. During an **attack**, certain amount of **energy** is released. 1 energy for small attack, 2 energy for middle attack and 5 energy for large attack.
5. No energy is released during a small defense or middle defense. 
6. During a big defense, 3 energy is released. 
7. When energy is overused, i.e. negative energy appears, the game is over. 

**Acquisition of energy & How to win**
8. After **save energy**, 1 energy is added. 
9. When a player attacks, there are three ways that the other can survive:
  a. Make an attack with higher level (e.g. middle attack--small attack). 
  b. Make the same attack (e.g. small attack--small attack). 
  c. Apply corresponding defense (e.g. small attack--small defense). 
  Otherwise the player who attack wins and the attacked player dies.
10. When the case in 9 a. occurs, the player exerting an attack with higher level wins.
11. When the case in 9 b. occurs, the player who defense absorbs energy released by player who attacks (**unilateral absorption**).
12. When the case in 9 c. occurs, both player absorb energy released by the other (**Mutual absorption**).

**Examples**
Example 1 
  Round 1
    Player A: Save energy.  Player B: Save energy. 
    (Both players have 1 energy after round 1) 
  Round 2 
    Plyaer A: Small attack. Player B: Save energy.
    Player A wins because player B does not make the same attack(as in 9 a.) or corresponding defense (as in 9.b). 
    
Example 2
  Round 1
    Player A: Save energy.  Player B: Save energy. 
  Round 2 
    Player A: Small defense.  Player B: Small attack. 
    (Unilateral absorption. A has 2 energy and B has 0 energy.)
  Round 3
    Player A: Save energy.  Player B: Save energy. 
  Round 3
    Player A: Middle attack. Player B: Small attack.
    Player A wins because A makes an attack with higher level. 

Example 3 
  Round 1 
    Player A: Save energy.  Player B: Save energy. 
  Round 2 
    Player A: Small attack. Player B: Small attack.
    (Mutual absorption. Both player have 1 energy after round 2.)
  Round 3 
    Player A: Save energy.  Player B: Save energy.
  Round 4
    Player A: Small attack. Player B: Middle defense.
    Player A wins because the defense by player B does **NOT** correspond with A's attack. 

Example 4
	Round 1-5
		Player A: Save energy.  Player B: Save energy. 
	Round 6
		Player A: Big attack. Player B: Big defense.
		(Player A releases 5 energy to attack. Player B releases 3 energy to make big defense. 
		Unilateral absorption occurs so that A has 0 energy while B has 7 energy after round 6.)
	Round 7
		Player A: Middle defense. Player B: Big attack.
		Player B wins.
